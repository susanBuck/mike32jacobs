## Blackjack planning
+ _Create a deck_
+ _Let the player determine how many players will play. For now, limit this to one player and a dealer. Add additional players 
+ _Deal to player first. Both cards up._
+ _Deal to dealer next. One card is visible, and the other is facedown._
+ _Player is presented with a choice. Hit, or stay._
+ _Future versions will also present the option to split or double down if conditions met. If card1==card2, the player can split. Each hand then becomes a new player. If card1+card2=9, 10, or 11, then the player can double down._
